# Project 2<br>Node/Express/MongoDB<br>Full-stack Application

## Overview

This second project will be your first adventure into **building a full-stack 
application.** You'll be building a Node/Express/MongoDB app from the ground up yourself.


You get to decide what you want to build - as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined below.

**You will be working individually for this project** designing and coding the app yourself.




## Planning & Presentation Requirements

### Planning - Due by Friday May 31st, 9:00 EST:

    
    1. A new Github Repo with your Project's name (DO NOT NAME THE REPO PROJECT2!) with a Readme containing all of your relevant information
    
    2. An **ERD** list containing an ERD identifying the attributes of each Data Entity (one for each Model and embedded schema). The ERD also needs to diagram relationships between the Entities (1:1, 1:M or M:M)

    3. Wireframe designs for your front end
     
    4. User Stories in your Readme for what you want your projects to contain

    5. MVP and Stretch Goals for your Projects

    6. A Trello Board for your personal schedule and daily goals (optional)


### Project Presentations - Friday June 7th, 10:00EST :

You will have 10 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:

1. **Introduce the Project:**

	☐ Intro your project by paraphrasing the README.
	
2. **Demonstrate the Project:**

	☐ Demonstrate the features of the app, including data operations.
  
  ☐ Demonstrate your user functionlity and interactivity 
	
3. **Show/discuss your code:**

	☐ Show your Mongoose models.
	
	☐ Show your Front End Axios functionality
  
  
4. **Share the experience:**

	☐ What was your biggest challenge?
	
	☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?
	
5. **Q & A + Feedback**



## Technical Requirements

### Your App Must:

☐ **Have at least 3 related data entities **

☐ Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, **it should have a consistent and polished user interface.**

☐ Have full CRUD on all models across the Back End


### Optionally, Your App May:

☐ Consume a third-party API.  If you choose to implement this option, it's likely that the data from the API will be a key data resource in your app, therefore it's important to consider how to implement whatever CRUD data operations will apply.  For example, how will data from the API find its way into your database?  Be sure to discuss with an instructor when planning your app's features.


☐ Have full CRUD functionality on both front and back end

## Necessary Deliverables

☐ **A working full-stack app that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you

- **A ``README.md`` file** with these sections (here's a [basic template](project-readme-starter.md)):

  ☐ **App Title:** Contains a description of what the app does and optional background info.
  
  ☐ **Screenshot(s):** A screenshot of your app's landing page and any other screenshots of interest.
  
  ☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used.

  
  ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).
  
  > Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted `README.md`. The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ **Daily commits (the more the better) dating back to the very beginning of the project**.

## Getting Started

- **Discuss your app idea with an instructor to get their feedback before you dive too deep into user stories and wireframes.**
- **Prioritize and implement the user stories one at a time**
- **Remember to keep things small and focus on the MVP** – feature creep can doom a project!

---

## Project Idea Guidance

Lots of the web applications you interact with on a daily basis can provide inspiration for this project as most are full-stack apps.  That is, they manipulate and display data.


#### Good Examples

Some of the best apps are apps that track or manage things of **personal interest to you**:
  
- Family Chores App
- Soccer team tracker
- Rock climbing planner

So much of the Internet is CRUD apps!

- Social media:
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  - Reddit
- Marketplaces: 
  - Craigslist
  - Etsy
- Organizational or Business apps:
  - Home Inventory planner
  - Personal planner
  - Customer management
  - Payroll/Accounting
 
- We do not like students making Mock ECommerce sites, if you do want to work on something like this it needs to be different in scope and functionality than our Hackathon Projects

Many simple apps can have their functionality enhanced by implementing the ability of users to comment on, and/or like/favorite items. 

---
## Asking For Help

-  Office/TA Hours will continue at the usual times through Project Week

---
## Plagiarism

- don't do it.

- if you have further questions, just ask

- ChatGPT can be dangerous for something like this. If you do use it, let us know which parts come from it, and make sure to test each functionality before moving on to the next step
